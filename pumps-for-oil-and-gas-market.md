<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pumps for Oil and Gas Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pumps</li><li>Positive Displacement Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The oil and gas market utilizes two primary types of pumps: centrifugal and positive displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps are designed to move fluids by converting rotational energy into hydrodynamic energy, ideal for transporting large volumes of liquids at lower pressures. In contrast, positive displacement pumps operate by trapping a fixed amount of fluid and forcing it through the discharge, making them suitable for high-viscosity fluids and applications requiring precise flow rates. Both types play vital roles in the extraction and transportation processes.</p></p>
