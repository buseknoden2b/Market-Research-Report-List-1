<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CMOS Image Sensor Chips Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Front-illuminated</li><li>Backside-illuminated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The CMOS image sensor chip market is primarily divided into two types: front-illuminated and backside-illuminated sensors. Front-illuminated sensors capture light through the front surface, making them less efficient in low-light conditions but more cost-effective. In contrast, backside-illuminated sensors position the photodiodes behind the circuit layers, allowing more light to reach them. This design enhances sensitivity and performance, particularly in low-light environments, making backside-illuminated sensors increasingly popular in high-end applications such as smartphones, cameras, and automotive systems.</p></p>
