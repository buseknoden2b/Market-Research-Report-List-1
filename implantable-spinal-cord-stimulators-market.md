<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implantable Spinal Cord Stimulators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rechargeable</li><li>Non-rechargeable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The implantable spinal cord stimulators market is divided into two main types: rechargeable and non-rechargeable devices. Rechargeable stimulators allow patients to recharge the implanted device while providing longer-lasting power and reduced battery replacement frequency. In contrast, non-rechargeable stimulators come with a fixed battery life and require replacement after depletion. Both types are designed to alleviate chronic pain by delivering electrical impulses to the spinal cord, but their operational features, patient management, and long-term use differ significantly.</p></p>
