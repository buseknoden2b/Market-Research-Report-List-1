<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thickness Gauges Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Thickness Gauge</li><li>Non-Contact Thickness Gauge</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The thickness gauges market comprises two main types: contact and non-contact thickness gauges. Contact thickness gauges utilize physical probes that directly measure thickness by making contact with the surface of the material, commonly used in manufacturing and quality control. Non-contact thickness gauges, on the other hand, employ techniques such as ultrasound, lasers, or electromagnetic waves to measure thickness without touching the material. These gauges offer advantages in speed and precision, making them ideal for delicate or inaccessible materials and applications.</p></p>
